                <h2> Question 1</h2>
                  <p> Choice A is correct. <br />
                    As we know, when a line is bisected, it is cut into two equal halves. So if BD is 3', we can infer that line BC is 6'. 
                      We know the perimieter of a triangle is the sum of its 3 sides. Becuase triangle ABC is equilateral, all we have to do is multiply 6' by 3 sides, putting the perimeter to 18'.
                   Remember that in addition to your math skills, the SAT will be testing you on your vocabulary as well.
