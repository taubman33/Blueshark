                            We can expect the SAT math to be not difficult in the depth of its questions, but moreso tricky about how their wording and content.
                            One thing to recognize in this question is that as we go through the different parts of the question, we will see some of the numbers we are working with in the answer choices.
                            This is a trap used by the SAT question writers to try and trick the student, especially as the test goes on and students get more tired and less focus.
